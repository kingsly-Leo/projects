# Machine Learning Project [24-PDS-013]

Short summary

This folder contains the machine learning project for the 24-PDS-013 course. It includes data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation artifacts.

Recommended structure (if not already present)

- data/               - raw and processed datasets
- notebooks/          - exploratory and training notebooks (.ipynb)
- src/                - reusable Python modules and scripts
- models/             - saved model artifacts (pickle, joblib, ONNX, etc.)
- reports/            - evaluation reports, plots, and summary PDFs
- requirements.txt    - Python dependencies

How to run

1. Create a virtual environment: python -m venv .venv
2. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open notebooks in notebooks/ to explore the analysis and reproduce results.

If you want, I can:
- add a detailed README with file-level descriptions if you provide the extracted folder contents,
- generate a requirements.txt based on imports,
- add example commands to reproduce model training and evaluation.
