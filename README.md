How to get more detailed READMEs

- For zip files: If you want, I can extract selected zip files into folders and add detailed README files describing the contents, requirements, and how to run the projects.
- For folders: I added starter READMEs inside folders to describe structure and next steps.

If you'd like me to expand any single project (extract zip, add instructions, add requirements.txt, or create notebooks), tell me which one(s) and I'll proceed.
