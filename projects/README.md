# projects/ (additional projects)

This directory contains additional projects or subfolders. I added this placeholder README to explain the purpose of the directory and to provide guidance for adding per-project READMEs.

What you can do next

- Add a README.md inside each project subfolder with a short summary, contents, and run instructions.
- Tell me which zip files you'd like me to extract and document in-place.
